        <li>Energizer vs. Duracell</li>
            <p>These are the products that power your PS controler, TV remote and so much more. Even though Enegizer has been around since the late 1800's, Duracell entered the marked in the mid 1960's giving Enegizer Bunny some serious competition</p>
        <li>Budwier vs. Miller</li>
            <p>Even though Coors is also up there with these two companies it is usually Budwiser and Miller that enter the mind when thinking of a cold refreshing beer.

        <li>Visa vs. Mastercard</li>

        <p>It's not to shocking to be finding these two on this list but is it no accident that these two are rivals as Pepsi was created to be a direct alternative to Coke. Despite all of Pepsi's marketing efforts over the years, Coke has managed to become the more successful company and to remain the top Amerian soda icon.</p>
