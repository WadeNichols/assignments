      <h1>How To Read Tabs</h1>
      <h4>Understanding Tablature</h4>
      <p>
        Tab (or tablature) is a method of writing down music played on guitar,
        bass, drums etc. Instead of using symbols like in standard musical
        notation, it uses ordinary characters and numbers. Tablature is possibly
        the best way to learn music for those who don't know special music
        notation. Reading tabs is easy, you won't have to go through this lesson
        twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Guitars usually have 6 strings (there are 7-string and 12-string guitars
        also, but we'll ignore them now). The first thing you have to know is
        the names of all the 6 strings. The top string is the thickest string,
        and it is called the 6th string or E-string because it plays E note at
        open fret (when you don't hold down any frets and just pick the string),
        assuming standard tuning. The next string is called 5th string or A
        string for similar reasons. The other string in order are 4th or D
        string, 3rd or G string, 2nd or B string and 1st or e-string (thinnest
        string). As the 1st and 6th string are both E notes, we distinguish the
        1st string by writing it in a smaller case "e".
      </p>
      <p>Now we are ready to move to tabs.</p>
      <h4>How To Read Tabs</h4>
      <p>
        The first thing you will notice about tabs is that there are six lines.
        They represent the six strings of the guitar and typically look like
        this:
      </p>
      <code className="list-container">
        <p className="code">
          <span>e</span>
          <span>|</span>
          <span>--------------------------------------</span>
          <span>|</span>
        </p>
        <p className="code">

        </p>
        <p className="code">
          <span>E</span>

      <p>
        We have written the string names (the note each string plays when you
        don't hold down any frets) on the left, this may not be given in all
        tabs. If it is not given, you'll have to assume that it is the same as
        we've written here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the top string of your guitar (the 6th or E string) is written
        at the bottom of the tab, and the bottom string (1st of e string) is
        written at the top. Many beginners get confused at this, but this is the
        standard way to write tabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also note that in some cases the string names may be written
        differently. These are the cases when the song is not played with
        standard tuning. That means the open strings don't play the notes E, A,
        D, G, B, e but some other notes. As this lesson is for beginners, we
        will stick to standard tuning guitar tabs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing you notice on a tab is the numbers. The numbers represent
        frets. 1 means 1st fret, 2 means second fret and so on. A 0 (zero) means
        open string. For example:
      </p>
      <code className="list-container">
        <p className="code">

        Tabs are meant to be read from left to right. Here in this tab, first
        you play D string at open fret, then G string at 2nd Fret, then B string
        and 3rd fret and so on. If you know your chords, then you would notice
        that this tab plays the notes of a D major chord.
      </p>
      <p>Another example:</p>
      <code className="list-container">
        <p className="code">

          <span>--0--0--x--x--x-----------------------</span>

      </code>
      <p>
        The difference between this tab and the first tab is that here multiple
        strings are hit at the same time, so this indicates strumming. At first
        you hold down and A and D string and 2nd fret and G string at 1st fret
        and play all 6 strings. If you're familiar with basic guitar chords,
        then you will notice that this is E major chord. According to the tab, E
        major chord is strummed twice. The next chord is A major which is
        strummed once and then D major is strummed twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The x indicates that that string is not played. Meaning you don't hit
        that string with your strumming hand. It could also indicate a dead
        note. This means that you play that string with your strumming hand but
        it doesn't make a sound because you muted that string with your other
        hand. Holding a string lightly (rather than pressing it firmly down at
        the fretboard) and hitting it creates a dead note. Whether or not a
        string is not played or it's a dead note can be confusing as they are
        both represented by x. Listening to the song will often give you a clue.
        For a beginner, assume that the x indicates that the string is not
        played.

      <p>
        First, D string at 9th fret is played. Then we notice 9h11. This means
        you put your finger at 9th fret, pick the string than hammer the 11th
        fret. Hammering means you pick a string with your finger at one fret,
        then without picking that string again you use your fretting hand to hit
        another fret (in this case 11th fret) hard enough to create sound.
        Remember, you pick once but get 2 notes when hammering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next we see 11p9. This means pick the string at 11th fret then
        "pull-off" that finger while another finger is already placed at 9th
        fret. It's like pinching the string at 11th fret with the fretting hand
        while you have a finger placed at 9th fret. The effect is like reverse
        hammering. 2 notes are played with one picking of the strumming hand.
        Hammering and pull-offs are often done in a row like 9h11p9. It's
        playing the 9th fret, then hammering the 11th fret and then pulling-off
        to 9th fret again. All with just one pick of the strumming hand. Sound
        difficult? You will learn it if you practice. It's not that hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we move along the tab, we notice 11/12. This means you hold down 11th
        fret and pick the string, then without releasing the pressure, you
        "slide" the finger to 12th fret. Again, you pick once but get two notes
        when sliding.
      </p>
      <p>
        \ is just sliding in the other direction. So 5\3 means slide from 5th
        fret to 3rd fret, picking only once (at 5th fret).
      </p>
      <p>
        ~ means just vibrating the finger when you hold down a string at a fret.
        It gives a nice effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        b means bending the string at a fret to give the sound of another fret.
        For a beginner, we would suggest avoid string bending for now, and don't
        try to play the tabs that have a lot of string bending.
      </p>
      <p>
        My final advice for the beginner who is now ready to read his first tab:
        start with a simple tab like "Come As You Are" - Nirvana or "All The
        Small Things" - blink-182.
      </p>
      <p>I hope this was helpful</p>
      <p>
        Don't give up on tabs, be patient, keep trying and you'll eventually
        succeed in playing your favorite songs on guitar!
