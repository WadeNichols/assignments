                <h1>The Road To Enlightenment</h1>
                <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs,
                    broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
                <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                    efforts of folk like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.</p>
                <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters.
                    Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating
                    fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

                <h1>So What Is This About?</h1>
                <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and
                    encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any
                    one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that
                    has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this
                    can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once
                    the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and
                    coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

                    <h1>Participation</h1>
                    <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
                        skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices
                        can use them as starting points. Please see the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS<p>Resource Guide</p></abbr> for advanced tutorials and
                        tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
                    <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting
                        at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and
                        use the sample files as a guide.</p>
                    <p>Download the sample HTML and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your
                        masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server
                        under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if
                        we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.

                    <h1>Requirements</h1>
                    <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS 1 & 2</abbr>usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS</abbr>should be limited to
                        widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is
                        about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the
                        browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.</p>
                    <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When
                        sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern
                        browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you
                        factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s
                        okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the
                        latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
                    <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep
                        objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual
                        themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing another garden-related design.</p>
                    <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your
                        graphics (with limited exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS
                        under a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that others may learn
                        from your work.</p>
